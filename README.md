# dragon_curve
Program that draws the dragon curve fractal pattern

This program produces a dragon curve fractal based on the user's prompted number of iterations. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCyC-K_PnRY for the math details. At a high level, the curve is defined by the directions Left, Right, Up, and Down, which are denoted by a list of characters L, R, U, and D respectively. To create the curve, think of your pen on a piece of paper and your pen drawing a line in the direction specified by the current item in the list. For example, L U means to draw a line left and then a line up.
